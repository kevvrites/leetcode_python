# Merge Two Sorted Lists
# https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/

# Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

# Example Cases
# Example 1
# Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
# Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]

# Example 2:
# Input: l1 = [], l2 = []
# Output: []

# Example 3:
# Input: l1 = [], l2 = [0]
# Output: [0]

# Constraints
# The number of nodes in both lists is in the range [0, 50].
# -100 <= Node.val <= 100
# Both l1 and l2 are sorted in non-decreasing order.
