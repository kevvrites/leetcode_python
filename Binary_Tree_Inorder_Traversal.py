# Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
# https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/

# Given the root of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

# Example Cases
# Example 1:
# Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
# Output: [1,3,2]

# Example 2:
# Input: root = []
# Output: []

# Example 3:
# Input: root = [1]
# Output: [1]

# Example 4:
# Input: root = [1,2]
# Output: [2,1]

# Example 5:
# Input: root = [1,null,2]
# Output: [1,2]

# Constraints
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 100].
# -100 <= Node.val <= 100
