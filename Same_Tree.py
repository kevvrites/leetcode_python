# Same Tree
# https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/

# Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

# Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

# Example Cases
# Example 1:
# Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
# Output: true

# Example 2:
# Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
# Output: false

# Example 3:
# Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
# Output: false

# Constraints
# The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
# -104 <= Node.val <= 104
